**Kaise ho sab!** ðŸ‘‹  

As a **Senior, Brother, and Friend**, I want to share some guidance with you all.  

I see many of you struggling with **time management**â€”juggling college, projects, assignments, and fests. I completely understand because Iâ€™ve been there too. From my own experience, Iâ€™ve worked extensively on **Java, Backend Development with Spring Boot, DevOps, and AI projects**.  

But let me be honestâ€”**as a fresher, none of this really matters when it comes to landing a job**. Even though I have knowledge equivalent to a **1-2 year experienced Spring Boot professional**, the reality is that in the industry, you never know which technology stack youâ€™ll end up working on.  

Thatâ€™s when I realized the real game-changer: **DSA (Data Structures & Algorithms) and Competitive Programming (CP).** ðŸš€  

I recently had conversations with **top engineers from META (San Francisco), Google, VMware, ATOS, JP Morgan (Vice President & SDE3), Walmart, Amazon, and Flipkart**, and they all gave me the same advice:  

ðŸ‘‰ **Forget about unnecessary projects. Focus entirely on DSA and CP.**  
ðŸ‘‰ **Practice daily on LeetCode, CodeForces, and participate in contests.**  
ðŸ‘‰ **Most companies conduct 3-4 rounds purely on DSA. Some might ask Low-Level Design (LLD), but projects barely play a role.**  

**So, my advice to 1st and 2nd-year students:**  
âœ… **Maintain a CPI of 8+**, but donâ€™t stress about college subjects too much.  
âœ… **Ignore the noise about "do projects."** Focus on DSAâ€”this is what gets you into top product-based companies.  

To help you all, Iâ€™ve created a **pathway** you can follow. I will also share **LeetCode & GFG contest links** every **Saturday & Sunday** in this group.

Stay focused, keep grinding, and letâ€™s build a strong future together! ðŸ’ªðŸš€
